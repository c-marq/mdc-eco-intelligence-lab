# College-Level Notebooks

Google Colab notebooks for the core AI curriculum. Designed for community college students with introductory to intermediate Python skills.

## Sequence

Work through these folders **in order** — each builds on the previous:

| Folder | Topic | Deliverable |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `01-data-exploration/` | Inspect, clean, and visualize water quality sensor data | D1 |
| `02-classification/` | Classify water conditions (safe/advisory/impaired) using ML models | D2 |
| `03-anomaly-detection/` | Detect sensor malfunctions vs. genuine environmental events | D3 |
| `04-time-series-forecasting/` | Predict seasonal water quality trends | D4 |
| `05-responsible-ai/` | Data bias, model limitations, human-in-the-loop validation, ethics | D5 |

## How to Use

Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of any notebook to launch it directly in Google Colab. No software installation required.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python familiarity (variables, functions, loops)
- No machine learning experience required — notebooks provide guided instruction

*Notebooks will be populated as the project progresses through Phase 0 and Phase 1.*
