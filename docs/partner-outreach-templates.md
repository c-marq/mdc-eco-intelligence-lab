**Subject:** EPA-Funded AI + Water Quality Education Project at MDC — Potential Collaboration

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm Carlos Marquez, a Professor of Applied AI and Data Analytics at Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus. I'm reaching out because your work at [Organization] on [specific area — e.g., Everglades freshwater monitoring, Biscayne Bay water quality] is directly connected to a project we're developing, and I'd welcome the chance to introduce it to you.

We've applied for an EPA Environmental Education Grant to build the **Eco-Intelligence Lab** — a two-year project (2027–2028) based at our Kendall Campus Environmental Center, which sits directly above the Biscayne Aquifer. The project installs water-quality monitoring stations on our campus lake system and teaches college students to analyze that data using AI techniques — classification, anomaly detection, and time-series forecasting — all grounded in South Florida's real water challenges.

What makes this project different from a typical classroom exercise is that everything we build becomes **open-access**. The Colab notebooks, curriculum, and facilitator guides will be published publicly for other institutions to adopt. We're also training college students as mentors who deliver AI-guided data exploration workshops to high school students and community members.

I'm writing now — before the grant decision — because I believe this project would benefit enormously from guidance and perspective from scientists who work with real environmental monitoring data every day. As we design the curriculum, having access to insights about what production-grade water quality analysis actually looks like — the sensor realities, the data quality challenges, the model decisions that matter — would help us teach students something authentic rather than theoretical.

I'm not asking for anything specific at this stage. I'd simply value the opportunity to share more about the project and hear your perspective on whether there might be areas of mutual interest. If you're open to a brief conversation — 20 minutes over Zoom or coffee — I'd be grateful for the time.

Thank you for considering this. I've included a link to our project repository below, which outlines the full scope and technical approach.

## Outreach Notes

### Before Sending
- [ ] Research the recipient's recent publications or projects — reference something specific in the email
- [ ] Replace all bracketed placeholders
- [ ] Ensure your GitHub repo README is polished (it's your first impression)
- [ ] Have a clear mental model of what you'd eventually want from this partner (even though you won't ask yet)

### What You Eventually Want (for follow-up conversations)
Based on the PRD deliverable registry, here's what industry partners could contribute:

| Deliverable | What You'd Ask For | How You'd Use It |
|---|---|---|
| D1 — Data Exploration | Example of a production data cleaning pipeline for multi-parameter sensor data | Adapt into instructional Colab notebooks showing students real-world data wrangling |
| D2 — Classification | Working classifier for water quality categorization (safe/advisory/impaired) | Simplify architecture, add instructional scaffolding, let students train and evaluate |
| D3 — Anomaly Detection | Approach for distinguishing sensor malfunctions from environmental events | Build student exercises around real anomaly scenarios |
| D4 — Time-Series Forecasting | Seasonal forecasting model for water quality parameters | Adapt for students to explore South Florida wet/dry season patterns |

### Timing
- **Now (pre-approval):** Send introductory email. Establish the relationship.
- **Post-approval:** Follow up with specifics. Share the PRD. Discuss what they might be willing to share.
- **Phase 0–1:** Receive and adapt partner contributions into curriculum.
