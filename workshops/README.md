# Workshops

Scaffolded materials for K-12 students and community members. These are **not** self-guided — they are designed for facilitation by trained college student mentors or faculty.

## High School Workshops (`high-school/`)

Pre-configured Google Colab notebooks requiring **no coding prerequisite**. Students visualize water quality trends, run pre-built models, compare AI predictions with sensor readings, and reflect on results.

- Adapted from college-level notebooks with reduced complexity
- Designed for 60–90 minute sessions
- Includes facilitator guides (see `mentor-training/`)

## Community Materials (`community/`)

Data interpretation materials for monthly community science events including BioBlitzes, Open Lab Data Interpretation Days, and Eco Club workshops.

*Materials will be populated during Phase 2 (Jul–Dec 2027).*
